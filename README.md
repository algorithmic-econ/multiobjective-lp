# multiobjective-lp

## Notes

### 11/07/2024
* Implement solver and use actualSolve
  * Allow to inject Gurobi under etc.
* Example dummy solver -> sum multiobjectives into one objective and run default PULP
* Documentation & package publishing
* Implement constrained mes as solver
* Compare solvers by fairness
* Criteria module to get metrics about provided solution, e.g:
  * sum of objectives
  * count of non zero objective
  * other examples, proportionality...
