    - Allow to inject Gurobi under etc.
- [x] Example dummy solver
    - sum multiobjectives into one objective and run default PULP
- [x] Documentation
- [x] package publishing
- [ ] Implement constrained mes as solver
- [ ] Compare solvers by fairness
- [ ] Criteria module to get metrics about provided solution, e.g:
    - [ ] sum of objectives
