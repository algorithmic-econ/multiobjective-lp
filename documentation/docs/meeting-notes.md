# Notes

## Test example
* Showcase core library without Pabulib, i.e., create model from scratch
  * Use MES with Bounded Overspending, Section 2, Table 1
* Implement greedy PB as solver

GH org - algorithmic-econ
## PropRank
py implementation is only for PB
change candidate removal (when infeasible) to be based on constraints instead of cost > budget

### Script to generate experiment configs for entrie pabulib


### How to check total budget
instead of checking C_ub_total_budget, check if there exists constraint with any name
that has given structure

### Future Solvers - Exponential MES
* Similar to MES add1
* Start with B_init
* In each round increase budget exponentially
* In each round we remove remaining candidates that would break feasiblity
* We keep selected candidates from previous rounds
* We keep unused budget from previous rounds
* Increase money until infeasible
* Fix selected projects
* Repeat

How to set B_init? - parameter of solver
* option 1 - start with small epsilon
* option 2 - solve equation for B_init to pick best project (cost/utility ratio) in the 1st round

# Modify MES implementation - more generic utilities
For objectives:
* instead of treating objectives as costs use utilities
* mapa dla kaÅ¼dego wyborcy -> ile przypisuje uÅ¼ytecznoÅ›ci dla danego projektu
* koszty projektu zostajÄ… w constraintach
* uÅ¼ytecznoÅ›Ä‡ = wspÃ³Å‚czynnik przy objecti
* _mes_internal == _for_fixed_budget

# New metrics
* cost utilities

#### LaTeX
The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such
that $f(a)=f(b)$.
